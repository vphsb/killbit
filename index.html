To create an HTML file that simply refers to another HTML file, you can use the <meta> tag with the http-equiv attribute set to "refresh". Here's an example of how to do this:

Create a new file with a .html extension in your text editor.

Add the following code to the file:

php
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>You are being redirected to another page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
